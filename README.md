# ProgrammingAssingment3Modified

This program takes user input for a shipment, including, order name, asks if the item is fragile, order total, and order destination. 
It uses control structures to determine the shipping costs if any and the new totals. This is outputted to the user and also wrote to a text file.

**Edited programming Assignment 3 to allow the input of one more destination as a planet. If that item is entered, prompt the user that we do not ship to other planets.
